## Why Denova

Denova is built for long-running creative projects and interactive entertainment. It brings together a writing IDE, interactive stories, structured lore, Agent tool calls, image generation, automation, and local version management in one project workspace so the creative process can iterate, recover, and accumulate durable context.

You can start from an original idea, import an existing novel for fan fiction, adaptation, or continuation, or import AI tavern character cards to quickly set up an interactive text adventure. Model-visible context is built with explicit sources, purposes, and size limits instead of blindly injecting the whole history, logs, or all settings into every turn.

## Core Features

- **Writing Mode**: fiction-focused Markdown editing, multiple tabs, global search, chapter statistics, outlines, chapter-group plans, progress tracking, and existing novel import.
- **Creative Agents**: read selections, files, and lore; call tools to generate or edit chapters; and use Skills / SubAgents for different writing tasks, prose styles, and workflows.
- **Game Mode**: run interactive text adventures with player input, story branches, storyline switching, action suggestions, scene memory, long-term story memory, and Story Director driven goals, pressure, costs, event card packs, and rule checks.
- **Lore and presets**: maintain durable settings such as characters, worlds, locations, factions, rules, and items; narrative styles handle prose, prompt slots, and scene style rules, while Story Directors can plug together narrative styles, event packages, TRPG Checks, State Systems, Story Memory Structure, and image presets, with each module independently switchable. State Systems also provide reusable trait libraries whose templates define draw rules for each kind of Actor.
- **Image creation**: generate chapter illustrations, interactive images, and book covers through OpenAI-compatible image model profiles, with previews and result management in the UI.
- **Context management**: progressively assemble model context, compact long memories, improve cache reuse, and keep tool results bounded to reduce noise and token cost.
- **Versions and restore**: save local versions, inspect diffs, restore history, and enable timed saves or automatic saves after large Agent outputs.
- **Automation**: schedule tasks, reviews, auto-continuation, and custom Prompt workflows.
- **Product experience**: Chinese and English UI, light and dark themes, OpenAI-compatible model setup, remote access, PWA phone usage, and Windows / macOS / Linux support.

## Writing Mode and Game Mode

Denova has two parallel workspaces. Writing Mode focuses on the fiction production line: ideas, settings, outlines, chapter plans, prose, and progress. Game Mode focuses on playable interactive narrative: player actions, story branches, scene memory, storylines, and choice-driven progression.

Game Mode includes built-in Story Director orchestration. The Interactive Agent interprets player actions and produces the turn-level TurnBrief, while backend tools only perform deterministic work such as schema validation, state settlement, and fixed-d20 rule checks. After each persisted turn, a background Director Agent maintains one branch-scoped `director.md` document. Its Prose-agent visible and Director private sections jointly cover stage hooks, lore anchors, important characters and factions, the current scene, clue density, checks and costs, crisis reversals, continuity, and near-branch arrangements. Interactive prose and hot choices read only bounded visible content from `director.md`, while private director sections remain available only to the background director. Creators can compose or disable a director's narrative style, event packages, TRPG Checks, State System, Story Memory Structure, and image preset, and can configure branch planning turns plus the single planning template. Director planning prioritizes important characters, factions, rules, and locations from the lore library and only invents temporary additions when lore is insufficient. Every playable turn should advance meaningful information, relationship change, pressure, reward/cost, or a new hook so the interaction keeps a high-density web-novel-like pace. Event cards carry a type name, Markdown event description, trigger scene, payoff/recovery notes, and scheduling metadata as director planning inputs instead of a runtime event queue. The State System defines Actor field schemas, defaults, bounds, visibility, initial Actors, reusable trait pools, and template draw rules. Protagonists, important characters, enemies, and monsters receive persisted trait-definition snapshots through the same creation flow. TRPG Checks provide reusable fixed-d20 rule templates and can use State Binding to read state fields for modifiers, while Story Memory Structure defines long-term narrative schemas. The prose Agent receives only a sourced, visibility-filtered current Actor state summary capped at 64KB; the complete trait library is not injected every turn.

The two modes share durable creative assets such as lore, presets, model and Agent configuration, Skills, version management, and base settings. Writing progress and chapter plans do not automatically enter Game Mode. If an interactive story should reference a passage or current writing milestone, move stable information into lore first or reference it explicitly in the input.

## Quick Start

### Download a Release

Download the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alfredxw/denova/releases), extract it, and run:

```bash
./denova
```

Windows users should run `denova.exe`. On macOS, if the system blocks the app for security reasons, run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine denova
```

### Run from Source

Requires Go 1.26.5+, Node.js 20+, and pnpm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfredxw/denova.git
cd denova
corepack enable
./bootstrap.sh
```

Default addresses:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`

## Models and Configuration

Denova uses an OpenAI-compatible API. The recommended path is to configure language models, image models, Agent parameters, the default Writing Skill, editor options, Game Mode behavior, version management, language, theme, and fonts from Settings.

For scripted startup or deployment, you can also override model configuration with environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.deepseek.com"
export OPENAI_MODEL="deepseek-v4-pro"
export OPENAI_IMAGE_API_KEY="your-openai-image-key"
export OPENAI_IMAGE_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL="gpt-image-1"
```

Optional Denova startup environment variables:

```bash
export DENOVA_WORKSPACE="/path/to/your-workspace"
export DENOVA_DIR="./.denova"
export DENOVA_SKILLS_DIR="./skills"
export DENOVA_WEB_DIR="./web"
export DENOVA_BACKEND_PORT="8080"
export DENOVA_FRONTEND_PORT="5173"
```

Configuration precedence:

```text
Built-in defaults < global config.toml < user-level config < workspace-level config < environment variables
```

Legacy workspaces and environment variables are still read for compatibility; new configuration should use `.denova` / `DENOVA_*`.

## Remote Access and Phone Usage

Denova can run locally, on your LAN, or on a self-hosted server. Release archives already include frontend assets; when deploying from source, build the frontend first:

```bash
pnpm --dir web build
```

Enable **Settings → Remote Access → Allow LAN access**, then set a username and password. Other devices can open the access URL shown in Settings. After signing in from a phone browser, you can add Denova to the home screen and use it like a standalone app.

For public or domain access, use a reverse proxy such as Caddy / Nginx to provide HTTPS. This avoids sending credentials in cleartext and keeps browser features such as clipboard access and PWA behavior working reliably.

Caddy example:

```text
denova.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

## Development

Start both frontend and backend:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Start frontend or backend separately:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh fe
./bootstrap.sh be
```

Allow LAN devices to access the frontend dev server:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh fe --lan
```
