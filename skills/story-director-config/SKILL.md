# Story Director Config

Use this skill before calling `write_story_directors` or `write_event_packages`.

## Workflow

1. Call `list_story_directors` first. For updates, call `read_story_directors` for the exact director IDs.
2. Call `list_event_packages` before changing a director's event package references. For event-card content updates, call `read_event_packages` for exact package IDs.
3. Use `write_story_directors` for director create/update/delete and `write_event_packages` for event package create/update/delete. Do not edit JSON files directly.
4. Built-in story directors and event packages can be read and copied as examples. Deleting built-ins restores their built-in version.
5. For update, preserve sections the user did not ask to change.
6. For delete, require an explicit user request.
7. When grounding event cards in the current work, call `list_lore_items` first, then `read_lore_items` for only the small relevant set. Do not claim concrete world, faction, character, or relationship facts unless they came from read lore, read director/package data, or explicit user input.
8. Story Directors, event packages, rule systems, and opening selectors are Game Mode-only module types. Do not add per-resource mode/scope fields.

## Shape

Story Directors are Game Mode modules independent from shared narrative styles and shared image presets. They combine reusable modules through `module_refs` and keep expanded resolved sections for inspection.

- `module_refs`: referenced module IDs plus switches. Use `narrative_style_id`, `event_package_ids`, `rule_system_id`, `opening_selector_id`, and `image_preset_id`; set `narrative_style_disabled`, `event_packages_disabled`, `rule_system_disabled`, `opening_selector_disabled`, or `image_preset_disabled` to `true` to turn a module off. When disabling, preserve IDs so the user can re-enable without reselecting.
- `strategy`: `enabled`, `mainline_strength`, `failure_policy`, `pacing_curve`, `random_event_rate`. Prefer the standard enum IDs used by the UI: `mainline_strength` is `soft_guidance`, `balanced`, or `strong_arc`; `failure_policy` is `reversible`, `consequence`, or `fail_forward`; `pacing_curve` is `progressive`, `wave`, or `goal-pressure-payoff`; `random_event_rate` is usually `0`, `0.08`, `0.15`, or `0.3`.
- `event_packages`: resolved event packages; used only by the background director planner and empty when event packages are disabled.
- `stat_system`: resolved attributes with `path`, `name`, `type`, `default`, optional `min`/`max`, and `visibility` (`visible`, `hidden`, or `spoiler`).
- `trpg_system`: resolved rule templates for checks, including `mode` (`default`, `d20_dc`, or `d100_under`), dice, modifiers, difficulty, outcomes, StateOps, and terminal candidates.
- `opening_selector`: resolved opening selector with `enabled`, `trait_pools`, and `initial_state_ops`; this affects only new stories or explicit opening rolls and is empty/off when the opening module is disabled.

Do not change `version`, `path`, `custom`, `invalid`, `error`, `created_at`, or `updated_at` unless preserving an existing complete object from `read_story_directors`.
Do not use empty IDs to mean disabled; use the explicit `*_disabled` switches. Do not write `event_system`, `event_system_id`, `event_system_disabled`, or `custom_events` in new data.

## Event Cards

Event packages are standalone resources made of rich event cards. Do not generate keyword-only category packages.

Each `events[]` item in an event package should use this schema:

- `id`: stable ASCII ID, unique inside the director.
- `type_name`: user-visible event type name, for example `外门考核打脸`.
- `description_markdown`: Markdown event card, up to 8000 characters.
- `enabled`: boolean.
- `category`: broad category such as `打脸`, `奇遇`, `学院`, `恋爱`.
- `tags`: short searchable labels.
- `weight`: positive number, usually `1`.
- `cooldown_turns`: non-negative integer, usually `2`.
- `intensity`: short value such as `low`, `medium`, `high`.

`description_markdown` should contain these sections:

```markdown
## 触发场景

## 背景融合方式

## 大致事件逻辑（起承转合）

## 事件回收 / 后果

## 奖励 / 代价

## 避免生硬的约束
```

Every card must bind to at least one concrete source from the work: a world rule, faction, place, item, character relationship, current conflict source, or user-provided premise. Do not generate generic "any protagonist anywhere" cards unless the user explicitly asks for a generic template package.

Default generation strategy:

- Generate 12-24 event cards in one package when the user asks for an event pack. Write the package with `write_event_packages`, then add its ID to `story_director.module_refs.event_package_ids` only if the user asked to attach it to a director.
- Cover a mix of 打脸, 扮猪吃虎, 奇遇, 秘境, 天降, 意外, 世界事件, 冲突, 学院, 比拼, 排行, 恋爱, 英雄救美, 误会与消解 where suitable for the actual work.
- Each card should describe a flexible reusable situation, not a fixed future chapter outline.
- The event must integrate with user action and current background; do not force the protagonist into a single choice.
- Include payoff/recovery hooks so the Director Agent can close the event later without leaving dangling pressure.
- If lore was not read, write cards using only user-provided facts and clearly keep them generic.

## Rule Checks

Use `mode` intentionally:

- `default` or omitted: compatible `total >= difficulty`.
- `d20_dc`: d20-style DC check using the same success condition as default, with success/failure tiers.
- `d100_under`: success when the d100 roll is less than or equal to the target value.

Keep `state_ops` explicit and reversible where possible. Avoid hidden state changes unless the user asked for hidden or spoiler attributes.

When writing the director back, use `write_story_directors` with the complete updated director object, preserve unrelated `module_refs`, and include a concise change message. When writing event cards, use `write_event_packages` with the complete updated package object.
