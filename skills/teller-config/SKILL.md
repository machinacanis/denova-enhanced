# Narrative Style Config

Use this skill before calling `write_tellers`.

## Workflow

1. Call `list_tellers` first. For updates, call `read_tellers` for the exact teller IDs.
2. Use `write_tellers` for create/update/delete. Do not edit teller JSON files directly.
3. Built-in narrative styles can be read and copied as examples. Deleting built-in styles is rejected.
4. For update, preserve slots and policy fields the user did not ask to change.
5. For delete, require an explicit user request.
6. Do not create or update `orchestration` here. Events, stats, TRPG checks, and opening trait rolls belong in `story-director-config` and `write_story_directors`.
7. Narrative styles are shared modules for Writing Mode and Game Mode. Do not add a per-style mode/scope field.

## Teller Shape

Important fields:

- `id`: stable ID. Required for update/delete; create may generate one if omitted.
- `name`: user visible name.
- `description`: short explanation of the narrative style.
- `tags`: short searchable labels.
- `context_policy`: controls which context groups the teller expects.
- `slots`: prompt slots used by writing and interactive story prompt assembly.

Do not change `version`, `path`, `custom`, `invalid`, `error`, `created_at`, or `updated_at` unless preserving an existing complete object from `read_tellers`.

## Context Policy

`context_policy` contains:

- `creator`: how to use CREATOR.md and creator-level rules.
- `lore`: how to use lore/context library.
- `runtime_state`: how to use current story state and turn context.

Keep these as short policy strings. They guide prompt assembly but do not replace runtime safety rules.

## Slots

Each slot contains:

- `id`: stable slot ID.
- `name`: user visible slot name.
- `target`: where the slot applies, such as `system`, `turn_context`, or another existing target read from a teller.
- `enabled`: boolean.
- `content`: prompt text for that target.

When modifying slots:

- Preserve slot IDs so existing UI selection and semantics remain stable.
- Keep slot content focused on narrative behavior, not backend tool permissions.
- Do not put story facts, chapter prose, or temporary scene state into teller slots.
- If a new slot target is needed, mirror the target style already present in existing tellers.

## Style Rules

`style_rules` maps scenes to inline style reference content:

- `scene`: scenario label.
- `style_contents`: list of text snippets used as prose style references. Each item is stored as text, not a file path, and should stay within 8000 characters.

Only add style rules when the user asks for scene-specific style behavior or when an existing teller already uses that pattern.

When writing the teller back, use `write_tellers` with the complete updated teller object and a concise change message.
