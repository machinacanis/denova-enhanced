# Image Preset Config

Use this skill before calling `write_image_presets`.

## Workflow

1. Call `list_image_presets` first. For updates, call `read_image_presets` for the exact preset IDs.
2. Use `write_image_presets` for create/update/delete. Do not edit image preset JSON files directly.
3. Built-in image presets can be read and copied as examples. Deleting built-ins is rejected.
4. For update, preserve fields the user did not ask to change.
5. For delete, require an explicit user request.
6. Image presets are shared modules for Writing Mode and Game Mode. Do not add a per-preset mode/scope field.

## Image Preset Shape

Important fields:

- `id`: stable ID. Required for update/delete; create may generate one if omitted.
- `name`: user visible name.
- `description`: short explanation of the visual style.
- `prompt`: visual constraints for image generation only. Keep it under 4000 characters.
- `tags`: short searchable labels.

Do not change `version`, `path`, `custom`, `invalid`, `error`, `created_at`, or `updated_at` unless preserving an existing complete object from `read_image_presets`.

## Prompt Guidance

The preset prompt is only for image generation. It should describe:

- medium or rendering style
- subject framing and composition
- lighting, color, texture, and mood
- negative constraints such as no text, no watermark, no logo, and no future-story spoilers

Do not put story facts, chapter prose, tool permissions, model settings, API keys, or temporary scene state into an image preset.
